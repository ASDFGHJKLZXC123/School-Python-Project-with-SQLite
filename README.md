## Project Overview
This project is an Airport Management System designed to manage airport-related data through a graphical user interface (GUI). The primary objective is to integrate the GUI with the functionality to access, edit, and read data from a provided SQLite database file (e.g., airport.db).

## Features
- Database Access: Connect to a pre-defined SQLite database file (airport.db).
- Data Management: Read, edit, and update information within the database.
- User-Friendly GUI: Interact with the database through an intuitive graphical interface
